# Astro ğŸš€ frontend to recive Server Sent Events from Codeigniter 4 ğŸ”¥

For now it's simple - connect to backend controller, recive server date, update frontend.

In future, I'll try to create whiteboard in canvas, send it's updates into database, and then, backend will try to check if frontent has recived last updates of whiteboard.
