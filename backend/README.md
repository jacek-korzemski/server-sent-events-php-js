# Codeigniter 4 ðŸ”¥ - Backend for Server Sent Events

Barebones files in repo - only things that was touched, or things that I was simply to scared to delete like license file etc.

Simple purpose: connect to controller, recive data. In future, connect to DB, check last record, is last record wasn't sent do frontend - send it to frontend.
