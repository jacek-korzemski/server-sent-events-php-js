# PHP Server Sent Events + JS frontend with ASTRO and Svelte

Simple project, just to practice Server Sent Events with PHP (becouse it's cheaper to host, than Node JS with WebSockets).

Right now - we have simple CodeIgniter 4 ðŸ”¥ backend with simple stream of server date, and Astro ðŸš€ frontend with Svelte ðŸ˜» component for dynamic data read.

Everything works fine. In future, I plan to create a DB connection, Canvas component, and try to create virtual Whiteboard to share with people.

Main purpose of this project is practice SSE, and test how much resources it is needed to read data from DB every 0.1s
